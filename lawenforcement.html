        <h2>Life On The Streets</h2>
        <p>Wasn't always easy, there were times that I felt like giving up. Long hours, backbreaking days. But as along as I had these things, I kept going.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Good support system</li>
            <li>Back-up</li>
            <li>Great friends</li>
          </ul>
        <p>I worked as an officer for 10 years, from 2012 until last year in 2021 to join nursing school. I did a number of different things for The Sheriff's, but the most fun assignments were forensics and adult programs</p>
