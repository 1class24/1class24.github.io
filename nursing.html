    <h2>The Job that will never be</h2> <!--a little about my choice to be here today-->
   	 <p>After a lifetime of military and Law Enforcement, I decided it was time for a change.  I needed something different in my life that was going to be equally or more fulfilling. </p>
   	 <p>I took a chance and quit my job as an officer and got accepted into nursing school. I went about half way until I realized the career just wasn't for me. When I finished my second block of school, that's when it hit me.</p>
   	 <p> I wanted to be a software developer. I had a friend that was doing it but I was always to scared to try it. I realized that I loved building things and this was the perfect fit.</p>
