      <h2>My Life In A Nutshell</h2> <!--a little bit about me-->
      <p>My name is Carlos Rumbo, and I am new to this world of software, and as you can see, this webpage is a little rough around the edges but it is something that I thoroughly enjoy.</p>
      <p>A little bit about me, I have been around doing a multitude of different things in my career. I am a native of Arizona, and have never wrote a single line of code before 3 weeks ago. This whole thing is still really confusing to me but I hope to soak it all in as much as possible.</p>
      <p>I have broken down my life into segments, and created links that will dive into what I have done in my past careers. I have done it all, from retail, fast food, banking, customer service, security, to my actual careers that I cover in my other pages.</p>
      <p>Some of the things that I have always loved and never realized i could do this for a living is to create things, to solve puzzles. In choosing to do this career, I get to do both and it's amazing.  On my spare time, I love to solve puzzles, one of the reasons law enforcement called out to me, and now with this new career, I can do it everyday.</p>
