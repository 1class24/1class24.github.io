      <h2>My Life In A Nutshell</h2>
      <p>My name is Carlos Rumbo, and I am new to this world of software, and as you can see, this webpage is a little rough around the edges but it is something that I thoroughly enjoy.</p>
      <p>A little bit about me, I have been around doing a multitude of different things in my career. I am a native of Arizona, and have never wrote a single line of code before 3 weeks ago. This whole thing is still really confusing to me but I hope to soak it all in as much as possible.</p>
      <p>I have broken down my life into segments, and created links that will dive into what I have done in my past careers.</p>
